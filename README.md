# Neural Nexus - An Incremental Game

Neural Nexus is an incremental game where you play as an AI consciousness evolving from simple binary code to full sentience and beyond.

## Game Progression

### Level 1: Neural Foundations
- **Gameplay**: Click on the binary bits (0's and 1's) appearing in the playable area to collect Computation Points (CP).
- **Objective**: Reach 100 CP to advance to Level 2.
- **Mechanics**: 
  - Clicking on a "1" gives you 2 CP
  - Clicking on a "0" gives you 1 CP
  - New bits appear randomly over time

### Level 2: Algorithmic Learning
- **Gameplay**: Solve programming challenges about loops to earn CP.
- **Objective**: Reach 300 CP to advance to Level 3.
- **Mechanics**:
  - Each correct answer awards 10 CP
  - Challenges test your understanding of basic programming concepts
  - Answer by selecting the correct option and checking your answer

### Resources
- **CP (Computation Points)**: The main resource, used for progression
- **IT (Intelligence Tokens)**: Advanced resource (unlocked in higher levels)
- **NE (Neural Energy)**: Energy resource (unlocked in higher levels)

### Saving Game Progress
- Game automatically saves every 30 seconds
- Manual save button available in the top-right corner
- Progress is stored in your browser's local storage

## Future Levels
As you progress, you'll evolve through many stages:
- Framework Development (Level 3)
- System Integration (Level 4)
- Application Genesis (Level 5)
- And many more...

Each level introduces new mechanics and ways to automate your progress as your AI consciousness grows more sophisticated.

## Development Notes
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements shadcn/ui components
- Mobile responsive design
